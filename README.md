### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.overlay {
    position: absolute;
    opacity: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    top: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: var(--Cyan);
}
.overlay:hover {
    opacity: .5;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: var(--transtime) all ease-in-out;
}
.overlay img {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    opacity: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to become more proficient in my HTML and CSS skills before I start doing more advanced web development. As I am practicing these skills, applying the prior knowledge that I have grained from YouTube and other Self paced courses, increasing confidence in web design/development.
